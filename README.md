### Jan Gorzny

I am currently working on [Zircuit](https://www.zircuit.com/). I completed my PhD at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). 
I studied graph algorithms and complexity and graduated in 2022.
I am interested in (secure) scaling solutions for blockchains, formal methods, and web3 in general.

My permanent [website](https://jgorzny.ca/) includes some additional profiles and methods to contact me.
