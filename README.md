### Jan Gorzny

I am currently working on [Zircuit](https://www.zircuit.com/). I completed my PhD at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). 
I studied graph algorithms and complexity and graduated in 2022.
At Quantstamp, I am exploring scaling solutions for various blockchains, formal methods, and security.

My permanent [website](http://www.crypticcode.ca/jan.gorzny/) includes some additional profiles and methods to contact me.
